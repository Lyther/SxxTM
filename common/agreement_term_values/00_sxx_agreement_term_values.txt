# Defines the different values available for given Agreement terms. The terms are defined in agreement_terms scripts.
# The term values contain the main logic of Agreement terms, including the modifiers and effects.
# For Subject Agreements, the owner is the overlord and the target is the subject.

# Example:
#
# name_of_term_value = {
# 	term = name_of_term 					# References the term in agreement_terms that this value applies to
#
# 	owner_modifier = {						# A modifier that applies to the Agreement owner country. Can stack multiple times.
# 		my_owner_modifier = 1
# 	}
# 	target_modifier = {						# A modifier that applies to the Agreement target country. Can stack multiple times.
# 		my_target_modifier = 1
# 	}
# 	unique_owner_modifier = {				# A modifier that applies to the Agreement owner country. Only applies once.
# 		my_unique_owner_modifier = 1
# 	}
# 	unique_target_modifier = {				# A modifier that applies to the Agreement target country. Only applies once.
# 		my_unique_target_modifier = 1
# 	}
# 	loyalty_change = value					# How much the subject's loyalty will change when a new agreement with this term starts
# 	triggered_loyalty_change = {			# How much the subject's loyalty will additionally change when a new agreement with this term starts, if "trigger" is true
# 		trigger = {
# 			agreement_scope_trigger
# 		}
# 		loyalty_change = value
# 	}
# 	extra_term_text_subject = <LOC_KEY> 	# What should be shown in the "extra terms" panel for the subject if this term value is active (default is to not show it)
# 											# This loc key can use $SUBJECT$ and $OVERLORD$ to show the name of the relevant empire, and $MODIFIER$ to show the modifiers applying to the subject
# 	extra_term_text_overlord = <LOC_KEY>	# What should be shown in the "extra terms" panel for the overlord if this term value is active (default is to not show it)
